Introducing Common Test Report Format

CTRF is a JSON schema designed to standardize test reports, ensuring that the same JSON report can be generated no matter which tool is used. It provides a consistent structure across all test frameworks and makes it easy to exchange test results between tools using our favorite data exchange format, JSON.

It's open source, community-driven, fully documented, and versioned. Easy to programmatically integrate with, simple enough to comprehend, customizable, and packed with properties that modern engineering frameworks support.

See the documentation for more information.
