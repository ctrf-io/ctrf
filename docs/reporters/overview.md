We have developed a collection of open source reporter plugins to generate CTRF compliant reports. These plugins are specifically designed to integrate seamlessly with a wide array of test libraries and frameworks across various programming languages.

## Easy Integration and Customisable Reporting

The mission is to make the generation of CTRF reports as effortless as possible, irrespective of testing tool, the official reporters offer:

**Cover Multiple Languages and Frameworks:** Whether you're working with JavaScript, Python, Java, or any other major programming language, the reporters are built to cater to a broad spectrum of testing frameworks and libraries.

**Support Various Test Types:** From unit tests to complex e2e, API tests and so on, the reporters are versatile enough to handle different testing methodologies.

**Configurability:** Recognising that different teams have different reporting needs, the plugins are designed to be configurable. You can enable or disable specific properties based on your requirements, ensuring that your reports are both comprehensive and relevant to your needs.

**Open Source Community and Contributions**
Our reporters are open source, ensuring transparency and continuous improvement but also opening the door for contributions from the development community. We welcome you to contribute to these plugins, helping us expand their capabilities and reach. Your contributions, whether they're in the form of new features, bug fixes, or enhancements, are invaluable in making these reporters more robust and versatile. See Contributing for more information. 

**Documentation for Each Reporter**
To help you get started with these reporters, we provide detailed documentation for each one. In these separate pages, you'll find specific instructions, configuration options, and usage examples tailored to each reporter plugin. This will guide you through integrating CTRF reporting seamlessly into your existing test suites and workflows.

## Missing a reporter for your test tool?

While our collection of open source reporters is extensive, we understand the vast landscape of testing tools and libraries is always evolving. If you find that a specific library or framework is not currently supported, we encourage you to get involved! You can request a reporter by raising an RFC, refer to the [RFC (Request for Comments)](/docs/contributing//contributing.md) docs to propose new ideas or request the addition of specific reporters.
