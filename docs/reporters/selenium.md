Selenium tests can be written in a variety of programming languages, including Javascript, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, and others. Because of this versatility, there's no one-size-fits-all reporter for Selenium tests. Instead, you should choose the reporter that is compatible with the testing framework and language you're using in your Selenium tests.
