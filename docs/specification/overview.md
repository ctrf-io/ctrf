The specification is divided into several main components, each serving a distinct purpose in the overall test report. These are:

[**Results:**](/docs/specification/results) The top-level object encapsulating the test run data.

[**Tool:**](/docs/specification/tool) Provides information about the testing tool, library or framework used during the test run.

[**Summary:**](/docs/specification/summary) Provides a high-level summary of the test run.

[**Test:**](/docs/specification/test) Provides detailed information about an individual test's execution and outcome.

[**Status:**](/docs/specification/status) Allowed values that indicate the outcome of a test

[**Custom Extras:**](/docs/specification/extra) Flexible property designed for custom extendability

## Examples

To help you better understand the application of the CTRF specification, we provide examples demonstrating its use:

[**Required Properties Example**](/docs/specification/examples#required-properties-only): The most straightforward report, utilising only the required properties of the specification.

[**Comprehensive Report Example:**](/docs/specification/examples#required-properties-only#comprehensive-report): A report that contains various optional properties capturing a wide range of test data.
