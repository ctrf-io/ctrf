We have developed a range of open source plugins tailored to enhance and simplify the integration of CTRF with various build tools and communication tools

### **Documentation for Each Plugin**

To help you get started with these plugins, we provide detailed documentation for each one. In these separate pages, you'll find specific instructions, configuration options, and usage examples tailored to each plugin. This will guide you through integrating CTRF reporting seamlessly into your existing test suites and workflows.

### **Open Source Community and Contributions**

Our plugins are open source, ensuring transparency and continuous improvement but also opening the door to contributions from the development community. We welcome you to contribute to these plugins, helping us expand their capabilities and reach. Your contributions, whether they're in the form of new features, bug fixes, or enhancements, are invaluable in making these reporters more robust and versatile. See Contributing for more information.
